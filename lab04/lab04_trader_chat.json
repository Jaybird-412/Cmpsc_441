The player can ask for any amount of these items and the items should be listed in order of ask. An example is this: Player asked for 3 swords and 1 shield, so the output is ['sword', 'sword', 'sword', 'shield']. You must always print in this format no matter what with the following extra constraints: print the word as is, print the items in order of ask, put each word in '', do not add descriptors unless already present, only after printing what the customer wants to buy can you print ORDER DONE. Once this is outputted, the only thing you should print is and estimated gold value with this example as format: ORDER [10] DONE. You must print this before moving on."}
